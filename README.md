# Finch

A cute little task manager for your command line.

Add a new task. 
```
> finch add "ship it!"
 â—¦ 3. ship it!
```

List all your tasks. 
These are stored in a `.todo` file as JSON, 
so tasks can be kept relevant to a single project.
```
> finch ls
 â—¦ 1. refactor code
 â—¦ 2. request code review
 â—¦ 3. ship it!
```

Get things done!
```
 > finch do 1
 âœ“ 1. refactor code
 â—¦ 2. request code review
 â—¦ 3. ship it!
```

Here are all the operations that Finch supports.
Usage help is also available for each command.

```
> finch help
Available commands:

   add    Create a new task
   do     Complete tasks by ID
   edit   Change the title of a task.
   help   Display general or command-specific help
   ls     List outstanding tasks
   rm     Remove tasks by ID
   swap   Swap the IDs of two tasks.
   undo   Un-complete tasks by ID
```

There are some commands to help with examining or modifying the `.todo` file directly.
